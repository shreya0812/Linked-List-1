// Time Complexity : O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list
// Space Complexity : O(1), since we are using only two pointers and no extra space
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : No

// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach:
// We use two pointers â€” slow moves 1 step, fast moves 2 steps.
// If there is a cycle, slow and fast will eventually meet inside the cycle.
// Once they meet, we reset one pointer to the head and keep both moving 1 step at a time.
// The node where they next meet is the start of the cycle.
// If the list has no cycle, fast or fast.next will become null, and we return null.
